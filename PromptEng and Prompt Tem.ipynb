    "Introduction to LangChain\n",
    "LangChain is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by language models. Built to address the challenges of working with LLMs in practical settings, LangChain provides a standardized interface for connecting models with various data sources and application environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain serves as an abstraction layer, making it easier to build complex LLM applications without handling the low-level details of model interaction. This framework has become a standard tool in the LLM ecosystem, supporting a wide range of use cases from chatbots to document analysis systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll focus on LangChain's prompt template capabilities, demonstrating how they can be used to create structured, reproducible interactions with language models across different application types.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt template\n",
    "Prompt templates are a key concept in LangChain. They help translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model. These templates can be used to guide a model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prompt template acts as a reusable structure for generating prompts with dynamic values. It allows you to define a consistent format while leaving placeholders for variables that change with each use case. This approach makes prompting more systematic and maintainable, especially when working with complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern LangChain (as of 2025) offers two main approaches to working with templates:\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional LLMChain approach\n",
    "The newer LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) pattern using the pipe operator | for more flexible composition\n",
    "LCEL has become the recommended pattern for building LangChain applications as it offers better composability, clearer visualization of data flow, and more flexibility when constructing complex chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a prompt template with LCEL, you typically follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define your template with variables in curly braces {}\n",
    "Create a PromptTemplate instance\n",
    "Build a chain using the pipe operator | to connect components\n",
    "Invoke the chain with your input values\n",
